# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian knowledge vault focused on AI security, machine learning, and privacy protection technologies. The vault contains Korean-language research notes, course materials, and technical documentation organized around several key learning domains.

## Vault Structure and Content Organization

### Primary Knowledge Domains

**AI Security Technology (`AI보안 기술/`)**
- Core research on AI security frameworks including Microsoft Presidio for PII detection
- Security development projects and hackathon materials
- Focus areas: PII anonymization, LLM security, privacy protection

**Personal Information Protection Training (`AI보안기술개발[개인정보반]/`)**
- Structured course materials on AI theory and information security
- PDF lectures and hands-on materials from July 2025 training program
- Key topics: AI system design, privacy regulations, security implementation

**Deep Learning Practical Applications (`DNN,CNN,RNN을 활용한 딥러닝 실무/`)**
- Comprehensive deep learning course materials with practical implementations
- Complete with practice files, datasets, and example code
- Covers neural networks, computer vision, and sequence modeling

**Data Analysis and EDA (`AICE AOSS 따기/`)**
- Systematic approach to exploratory data analysis
- Business data understanding and visualization techniques
- Structured learning path for data analysis certification

**Small Language Model Fine-tuning (`sLM 파인튜닝/`)**
- Specialized content on Microsoft Phi3 and small language model optimization
- Focus on efficient model training and deployment strategies

**Personal Information Monitoring (`개인정보 불법유통 대응모니터링단/`)**
- Operational guidelines for privacy violation detection and response
- Regulatory compliance and monitoring frameworks

### Technical Infrastructure

**Obsidian Configuration**
- Smart Composer plugin installed for AI-assisted writing
- Korean language interface with standard workspace layout
- Base files (`.base`) and Canvas files (`.canvas`) for structured knowledge representation

**Vector Database Integration**
- Smart Connections plugin with compressed vector database (`.smtcmp_vector_db.tar.gz`)
- JSON database for semantic search and knowledge linking (`.smtcmp_json_db/`)

## Working with This Vault

### Content Creation and Organization
- All notes are in Korean and follow academic/technical documentation style
- Use folder-based organization matching the learning domain structure
- Maintain consistent file naming with descriptive titles
- Link related concepts using Obsidian's linking syntax

### Knowledge Retrieval
- Use Smart Composer for semantic search across the knowledge base
- Leverage the vector database for finding related concepts and materials
- Cross-reference between theoretical concepts and practical implementations

### Content Standards
- Technical documentation should include both theory and practical examples
- Code examples should be properly formatted and annotated in Korean
- Maintain connections between course materials and research applications
- Include proper citations and references for external sources

## Key Learning Workflows

1. **AI Security Research**: Start with `AI보안 기술/` for foundational concepts, then apply to practical scenarios in training materials
2. **Deep Learning Implementation**: Use the practical course materials in `DNN,CNN,RNN을 활용한 딥러닝 실무/` with the included practice files
3. **Data Analysis Projects**: Follow the systematic EDA approach documented in `AICE AOSS 따기/`
4. **Privacy Protection Applications**: Combine materials from personal information protection training with AI security frameworks

This vault serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for AI security research and practical implementation, with emphasis on Korean regulatory context and real-world applications.
